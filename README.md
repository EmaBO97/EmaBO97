# 🤖 Emanuele Bua Odetti
### Robotics & Control Engineer | EMARO+ Double Degree (Centrale Nantes & UniGe)

I specialize in **High-Dynamic Systems** and **Agile Mechatronics**. My work focuses on nonlinear control, high-fidelity system identification, and pushing robots to their physical limits.

## 🚀 Master Thesis: "BumbleBee" Platform
*Research conducted at INRIA Rennes (Rainbow Team)*

I designed, built, and validated a novel quadrotor platform optimized for agile flight and collaborative transportation.

### 🛠️ Technical Deep-Dive:
- **Control & Software:** Implemented **Nonlinear Geometric Control (SO(3))** and **Differential Flatness** trajectory generation. Extended the **telekyb3** framework to support axis-asymmetric PID tuning.
- **Sim-to-Real:** Developed a custom **HIL Test Bench** that identified a 22% discrepancy in manufacturer thrust data, enabling high-fidelity Gazebo simulations.
- **Mechatronics:** Optimized the hardware stack (low COM, high TWR 4.1) achieving a **2x improvement in angular responsiveness** compared to legacy systems.

### 📽️ Agile Maneuvers in telekyb3:
